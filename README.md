WindowsFormRH, a C# Project

I am learning C# and object-oriented programming, and since I really enjoy working with desktop applications, I decided to set aside HTML and practice with Windows Forms in Visual Studio.

All updates are done solely by me.

In this option, it's possible to store clients using generic lists.

It's also connected to the postal service API to retrieve addresses based on ZIP codes.
